1. Create 10 directories with for loop.

#!/bin/bash

for a in {1..10}
do
        mkdir directory$a
done


2. create 5 directoty with name as file1, file2...file5 and 5 more directory
   as dir1, dir2....dir5. Delete the file1,file2...file5 only (use loop)

#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter the directory name:" f

for a in {1..5}
do
        mkdir $f$a
        mkdir dir$a
        rmdir $f$a
done


3. Create 5 files and input some 5 line data into the file. Finally print the 3rd line of each file.

#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter the file name:" f

for a in {1..5}

do
        touch $f$a
        echo "Higher domestic demand and a pick-up in capital investment is expected to help
the Indian economy grow 6.5 per cent in real terms in FY24 or 2023-24,
the Economic Survey is learnt to have projected.
In nominal terms, the GDP growth rate is expected to be around 11 per cent,
suggesting an average annual inflation during the next financial year to be 4.5 per cent." >> $f$a

	  head -n 3 $f$a | tail -n 1
done

 

4. Create 5 files and input some 5 line data into the file. Do find and replace

#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter the file name:" f

for a in {1..5}

do
        touch $f$a
        echo "Higher domostic demand " >> $f$a
        sed -i 's/domostic/domestic/g' $f$a 

done



5.run ls -la command and extract the last column and 
print each name of the column with echo command with some string.


ls -la | awk '{print " This is a ls -la last column "$9}'



6. check the memory usage status of your server and print the free/available column in human readable format.


free -h | awk '{print $4 $7}' >> readable_file



7. check the disc free status and print the first and last column in file (if use percentage is greater than 50%).


df -h | awk '$5 >= 50 {print $1 $NF}'


---------------------------------

df -h | wc -l

df -h | awk '{print$5}'

for a in { if [[ 0 > 50]] }
do
	

done


8. collect input while running script and do find & replace in file with input data, print the result.


#!/bin/bash

input1=file

input2=increase

input3=increases

for a in $input1

do
        sed -i 's/$input2/$input3/g' $input1 -- this is not work
	  
	  sed -i 's/$input2/$input3/g' $input1 --this is work

        
	  cat $input1

done



 echo "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced an increase in the income tax rebate limit from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 7 lakh under the new tax." $input1



9. input file name and extention like (.txt, .json, .yml..etc). 
Based on the input it should create 5 file like file1.txt...file5.txt 
(or) file.json...file5.json (or) file1....file5.yml depends upon your input.

#!/bin/bash

input1=panneer
input2=.txt
for a in {1..5}

do
        touch $input1$a$input2
done


10. create 5 file with different number of lines manually. 
create script and get the file name as input while running the script, 
count the number of lines and characters present in the file and print it.

#!/bin/bash



file1=selvam1
file2=selvam2
file3=selvam3
file4=selvam4
file5=selvam5

for a in $file1

do

        cat $file1 | wc -l
        cat $file1 | wc -m
	  cat $file2 | wc -l
        cat $file2 | wc -m
        cat $file3 | wc -l
        cat $file3 | wc -m
	  cat $file4 | wc -l
        cat $file4 | wc -m
	  cat $file5 | wc -l
        cat $file5 | wc -m


done
